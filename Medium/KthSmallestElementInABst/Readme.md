## Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth (1-indexed) smallest element in the tree. <br> 
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3 <br> 
Output: 3 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the tree is n. <br> 
1 <= k <= n <= 104 <br> 
0 <= Node.val <= 104 <br> <br> <br> 
Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize? <br>
