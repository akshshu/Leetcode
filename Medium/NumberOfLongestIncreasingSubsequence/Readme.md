## Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences. <br> <br> 
Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7] <br> 
Output: 2 <br> 
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7]. <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2] <br> 
Output: 5 <br> 
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
1 <= nums.length <= 2000 <br> 
-106 <= nums[i] <= 106 <br>
