## Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom. <br> <br> 
For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]] <br> 
Output: 11 <br> 
Explanation: The triangle looks like: <br> 
   2 <br> 
  3 4 <br> 
 6 5 7 <br> 
4 1 8 3 <br> 
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above). <br>
