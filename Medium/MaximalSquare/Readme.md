## Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area. <br> <br> 
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]] <br> 
Output: 1 <br> 
Example 3: <br> <br> 
Input: matrix = [["0"]] <br> 
Output: 0 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
m == matrix.length <br> 
n == matrix[i].length <br> 
1 <= m, n <= 300 <br> 
matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'. <br>
