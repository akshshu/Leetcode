## Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice. <br> <br> 
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1] <br> 
Output: [2,3] <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [1,1,2] <br> 
Output: [1] <br> 
Example 3: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [1] <br> 
Output: [] <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
n == nums.length <br> 
1 <= n <= 105 <br> 
1 <= nums[i] <= n <br> 
Each element in nums appears once or twice. <br>
