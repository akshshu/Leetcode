## You are given an array of positive integers nums and want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements. <br> <br> 
Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray. <br> <br> 
An array b is called to be a subarray of a if it forms a contiguous subsequence of a, that is, if it is equal to a[l],a[l+1],...,a[r] for some (l,r). <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [4,2,4,5,6] <br> 
Output: 17 <br> 
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is [2,4,5,6]. <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [5,2,1,2,5,2,1,2,5] <br> 
Output: 8 <br> 
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is [5,2,1] or [1,2,5]. <br>
