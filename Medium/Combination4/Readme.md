## Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target. <br> <br> 
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4 <br> 
Output: 7 <br> 
Explanation: <br> 
The possible combination ways are: <br> 
(1, 1, 1, 1) <br> 
(1, 1, 2) <br> 
(1, 2, 1) <br> 
(1, 3) <br> 
(2, 1, 1) <br> 
(2, 2) <br> 
(3, 1) <br> 
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations. <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [9], target = 3 <br> 
Output: 0 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
1 <= nums.length <= 200 <br> 
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000 <br> 
All the elements of nums are unique. <br> 
1 <= target <= 1000 <br> <br> <br> 
Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers? <br> <br>
