## Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal. <br> <br> 
A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2 <br> 
Output: 4 <br> 
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below: <br> 
[1,0,1,0,1] <br> 
[1,0,1,0,1] <br> 
[1,0,1,0,1] <br> 
[1,0,1,0,1] <br>
