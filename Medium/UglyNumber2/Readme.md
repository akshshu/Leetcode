## An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. <br> <br> 
Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: n = 10 <br> 
Output: 12 <br> 
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers. <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: n = 1 <br> 
Output: 1 <br> 
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
1 <= n <= 1690 <br>
