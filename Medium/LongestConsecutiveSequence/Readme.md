## Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. <br> <br> 
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] <br> 
Output: 4 <br> 
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4. <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1] <br> 
Output: 9 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
0 <= nums.length <= 105 <br> 
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109 <br>
