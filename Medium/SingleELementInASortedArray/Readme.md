## You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once. <br> <br> 
Follow up: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8] <br> 
Output: 2 <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11] <br> 
Output: 10 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5 <br> 
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5 <br>
