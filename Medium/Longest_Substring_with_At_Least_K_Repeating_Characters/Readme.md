## Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3 <br> 
Output: 3 <br>

Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2 <br>
