## Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list. <br> 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5] <br> 
Output: [5,4,3,2,1] <br> 
Input: head = [1,2] <br> 
Output: [2,1] <br> 
Example 3: <br> <br> 
Input: head = [] <br> 
Output: [] <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000]. <br> 
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000 <br> <br> <br> 
Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both? <br>
