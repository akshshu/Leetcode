## Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it. <br> <br> 
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2] <br> 
Output: 3 <br>
