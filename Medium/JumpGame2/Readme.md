## Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. <br> <br> 
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. <br> <br> 
Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps. <br> <br> 
You can assume that you can always reach the last index. <br>
