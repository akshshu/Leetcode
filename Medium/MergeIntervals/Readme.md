## Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] <br> 
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]] <br> 
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6]. <br>
