## Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). <br> <br> 
A valid BST is defined as follows: <br> <br> 
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. <br> 
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. <br> 
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. <br>
