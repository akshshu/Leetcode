## You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only. <br> <br> 
Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number. <br> <br> 
For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123. <br> 
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer. <br> <br> 
A leaf node is a node with no children. <br>
