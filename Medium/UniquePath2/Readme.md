## A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below). <br> <br> 
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below). <br> <br> 
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be? <br> <br> 
An obstacle and space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. <br>
