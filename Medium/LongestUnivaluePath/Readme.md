## Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest path, where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root. <br> <br> 
The length of the path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> <br> 
Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,5] <br> 
Output: 2 <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> <br> 
Input: root = [1,4,5,4,4,5] <br> 
Output: 2 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. <br> 
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000 <br> 
The depth of the tree will not exceed 1000. <br>
