## Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n. <br> <br> 
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: n = 12 <br> 
Output: 3 <br> 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4. <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: n = 13 <br> 
Output: 2 <br> 
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9. <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
1 <= n <= 104 <br>
