## Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. <br> <br> 
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [2,2,1] <br> 
Output: 1 <br>
