## Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth. <br> <br> 
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. <br> <br> 
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] <br> 
Output: 3 <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. <br> 
-100 <= Node.val <= 100 <br>
