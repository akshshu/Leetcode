## Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not. <br> <br> 
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> 
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3] <br> 
Output: true <br> 
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2] <br> 
Output: false <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100]. <br> 
-104 <= Node.val <= 104 <br>
