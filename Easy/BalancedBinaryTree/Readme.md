## Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced. <br> <br> 
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as: <br> <br> 
a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> <br> 
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] <br> 
Output: true <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> <br> 
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4] <br> 
Output: false <br> 
Example 3: <br> <br> 
Input: root = [] <br> 
Output: true <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000]. <br> 
-104 <= Node.val <= 104 <br>
