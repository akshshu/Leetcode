## Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s. <br> <br> 
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position. <br> <br> 
For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift. <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab" <br> 
Output: true <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced" <br> 
Output: false <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100 <br> 
s and goal consist of lowercase English letters. <br>
