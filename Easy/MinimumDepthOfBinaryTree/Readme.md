## Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. <br> <br> 
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. <br> <br> 
Note: A leaf is a node with no children. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1:Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] <br> 
Output: 2 <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6] <br> 
Output: 5 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105]. <br> 
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000 <br>
