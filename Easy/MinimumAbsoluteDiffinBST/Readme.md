## Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> 
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3] <br> 
Output: 1 <br> 
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49] <br> 
Output: 1 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 104]. <br> 
0 <= Node.val <= 105 <br>
