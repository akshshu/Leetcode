## Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] <br> 
Output: 6 <br> 
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [1] <br> 
Output: 1 <br> 
Example 3: <br> <br> 
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8] <br> 
Output: 23 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104 <br> 
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105 <br> <br> <br> 
Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle. <br>
