## An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. <br> <br> 
Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: n = 6 <br> 
Output: true <br> 
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3 <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: n = 8 <br> 
Output: true <br> 
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2 <br> 
Example 3: <br> <br> 
Input: n = 14 <br> 
Output: false <br> 
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7. <br> 
Example 4: <br> <br> 
Input: n = 1 <br> 
Output: true <br> 
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. <br>
