## Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center). <br> 
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] <br> 
Output: true <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. <br> 
-100 <= Node.val <= 100 <br> <br> <br> 
Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively? <br>
