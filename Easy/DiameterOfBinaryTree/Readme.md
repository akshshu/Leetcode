## Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree. <br> <br> 
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. <br> <br> 
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> <br> 
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5] <br> 
Output: 3 <br> 
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3]. <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: root = [1,2] <br> 
Output: 1 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. <br> 
-100 <= Node.val <= 100 <br>
