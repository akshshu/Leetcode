## Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram. <br> 
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3] <br> 
Output: 10 <br> 
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1. <br> 
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units. <br> 
Input: heights = [2,4] <br> 
Output: 4 <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
1 <= heights.length <= 105 <br> 
0 <= heights[i] <= 104 <br>
