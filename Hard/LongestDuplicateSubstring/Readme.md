## Given a string s, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of s that occur 2 or more times. The occurrences may overlap. <br> <br> 
Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If s does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "". <br> <br> <br> <br> 
Example 1: <br> <br> 
Input: s = "banana" <br> 
Output: "ana" <br> 
Example 2: <br> <br> 
Input: s = "abcd" <br> 
Output: "" <br> <br> <br> 
Constraints: <br> <br> 
2 <= s.length <= 3 * 104 <br> 
s consists of lowercase English letters. <br>
